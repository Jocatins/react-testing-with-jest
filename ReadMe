2 - Third party code

RTL Queries
Queries are the methods that testing library provides to find elements on the page

To find a single element on the page

- getBy
- queryBy
- findBy

To find multiple elements on the page

- getAllBy
- queryAllBy
- findAllBy

`getBy` - This is used to find a single element in the DOM based on a specific criteria.
Example --> `getByRole`, `getByText`, `getByTestId`

`getAllBy` - This set of query method is used to find multiple elements in the DOM based
on specific criteria
Example ---> `getAllByRole`, `getAllByText` , `getAllBy`

`queryBy` - This set of query methods is used to find an element in the DOM.
These queries should be used when you need to find a specific element and you are not sure
will be present in the DOM.
Example ---> `queryByRole`, `queryByText`, `queryByTestId`, `queryBy`

`queryAllBy` - This set of query methods is used to find multiple elements in the DOM.
These methods return an empty array if no matching elements are found.
Example ---> `queryAllByRole`, `queryAllByText`, `queryAllBy`

`findBy` - This set of query methods is used to find a single element in the DOM based
on a specific criteria asynchronously. These queries should be used when you need to find
a specific element in the DOM that may not be present immediately, such as when waiting
for an API call to be completed.
Example ---> `findBy`, `findByRole`, `findByText`

`waitFor` - This utility function is used to wait for a specific condition to be true before continuing
with a test. Examples of conditions, wait for appearance or disappearance of an element, a change in
text-content of an element, for async behaviors.
